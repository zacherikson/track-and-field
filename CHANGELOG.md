# Changelog

Gameplay and tuning changes, newest first. When you change a number in
`src/config.js`, log the old → new value and why it felt better.
`node tools/simulate.mjs` shows what a change does to race times.

## Step 2.8: tuning from play-testing on the phone
Set with the in-game tuning panel after real play, then made the defaults:

| Setting | Old | New |
|---|---|---|
| Forgiveness curve (`runner.speedCurve`) | 0.75 | 0.60 |
| Newest tap weight (`runner.cadenceSmoothing`) | 0.30 | 0.40 |
| Acceleration (`runner.accelMax`) | 9.0 | 10.0 m/s² |
| Slow-down rate (`runner.coastDecel`) | 4.0 | 3.0 m/s² |
| Hesitation allowance (`runner.idleGrace`) | 1.4× | 1.2× gap |
| Longest gap counted (`runner.maxIntervalForAvg`) | 700 | 600 ms |
| Speed lost on a miss (`sprint100.targets.missSpeedLoss`) | 1.5 | 1.0 m/s |
| Penalty pause (`sprint100.targets.missLockout`) | 250 | 170 ms |
| Coasting slow-down (`dip.carryDecel`) | 0.6 | 0.5 m/s² |

- AI rivals' miss penalty now matches the player's (1.0 m/s, 170 ms).
- Simulator after the change:

  | Strategy | Before | After |
  |---|---|---|
  | Casual reader | 11.0s | 10.5s |
  | Good reader | 9.7s | 9.4s |
  | Expert | 9.1s | 8.9s |
  | Amateur AI winner (median) | 10.8s | 10.25s |
  | Blind alternating at 14/s | stuck | 9.7s |

- Watch: cheaper mistakes make blind alternating competitive again.

## Step 2.7: no animations on the targets
Too many effects; starting fully simple.
- The green target appears instantly on its fixed spot and disappears the moment
  it's hit. The fly-in, trail, closing ring, breathing, hit ring burst and sparks
  are all removed (the `sprint100.pads.spawn` config is gone).
- The red ✕ simply shows during the lockout (no pop or shake).
- The orange dip pads no longer pulse.
- The glossy button look is unchanged.

## Step 2.6: in-game tuning panel
- New **⚙ Tuning** button on the menu and results screens. It opens an overlay
  with every speed-related setting in plain language: tapping pace, speeding up,
  slowing down, mistakes, targets, finish dip, and rival pace.
- Each setting has a slider, − / + buttons, its default, and a reset link.
  Changed settings are outlined in green.
- Live estimates run the real physics:
  - 100m time at 3, 4 and 5 hits/s
  - what one mistake costs
  - the Amateur rivals' usual winning time
- Changes apply to the next race and are saved on the device (localStorage).
  **Copy changes** puts a readable summary on the clipboard to paste into chat.
  Adopted changes get baked into `src/config.js` and logged here.
- Results screen now shows hits · misses · hits/s · top speed.

## Step 2.5: two states only, brighter colors
- Only two states: a green target (tap now) or a red ✕ (wrong side, wait). The
  grey "locked" target is gone. After a wrong tap the target is hidden behind the
  ✕ for the whole 0.25s lockout, then flies back in.
- The ✕ is bold red with a white outline and pops in with a short shake.
- Pads are glossy candy buttons: vivid gradient body (green #39e626, orange
  #ff9d14), darker rim, thick white ring, highlight and a soft drop shadow.

## Step 2.4: fixed target spots, no countdown pads
- Each side's target always lands on the same spot (removed `pads.followThumb`).
  Following the thumb added nothing, because the hit zone was already the whole
  screen half. A fixed spot is easier to read and learn.
- Removed the red pads during READY / GET SET. The first thing to appear is the
  first green target at GO. Tapping before it is still a false start.
- Removed the faint outline ring on the unlit side. During the race the only
  circle is the green target (plus hit and miss effects).
- The fly-in entrance is unchanged; it just always lands on the fixed spot.

## Step 2.3: target entrance animation
Previously each target popped up in the same spot every time, which looked static.
Now every appearance flies in (config `sprint100.pads.spawn`):
- It flies 80px toward its resting spot in 0.13s, from above and the screen-center
  side, at a random angle (±0.55 rad), so no two entrances look the same.
- Ease-out-back motion with a slight overshoot (`overshoot` 1.7), squash and
  stretch along the flight path, 3 fading afterimages, and a ring that closes in
  on the landing spot.
- Once settled, the target gently "breathes" (±2.5% scale).
- The resting spot still follows your thumb, so you never have to reach. The pad
  is on the correct half of the screen from the first frame, so reading the side
  isn't delayed.
- A hit also throws a small burst of sparks. The red countdown pads and orange
  DIP pads use the same entrance.

## Step 2.2: random targets (never 3 in a row), because reading beats mashing
Per design feedback on the original: the target side is random, but there are never
more than 2 in a row on one side. After two lefts the next is guaranteed right, so
you can learn to pre-empt it.
- New `src/events/strideTargets.js` (`TargetSequence` + `StrideTargets`), config
  `sprint100.targets`: `maxSameSide` 2, `switchChance` 0.5 (overall switch rate 2/3).
- Tapping the lit side = a stride. Same-side repeats are now valid.
- Wrong-side tap: red ✕, −1.5 m/s, and a 0.25s lockout (the target greys out).
  First try was −0.8 m/s and 0.15s, but then blindly alternating at 14 taps/s
  (9.6s) beat a good reader (10.4s).
- Inputs within 60ms of a hit are ignored (`minStrideInterval`), so drumming both
  thumbs can't score two strides per press.
- Runner API: `stride(t)` and `stumble(loss)` replace `tap(side, t)`. Each event now
  decides what a correct input is (the hurdles' 1-2-3 will reuse this).
- Retuned for reaction-paced play (about 3–6 hits/s instead of 12–15 taps/s):
  - `cadenceForTopSpeed` 15 → 5.2 strides/s
  - `maxIntervalForAvg` 0.5 → 0.7
  - new `idleGrace` 1.4: a normal hesitation doesn't wobble your speed
- AI rivals: cadence ranges retuned (amateur 2.9–3.8, pro 3.9–4.9 strides/s), plus
  occasional misreads that cost them the same penalty (`missChance`).
- Fix: a slow runner could coast to a standstill in the dip zone and never finish.
  They now keep running normally below `dip.minCarrySpeed` (5 m/s).
- Simulator (`node tools/simulate.mjs`) now races strategies through the real rules:

  | Strategy | Time |
  |---|---|
  | Novice reader | 12.9s |
  | Casual reader | 11.0s |
  | Casual, ignoring the max-2 rule | 12.25s |
  | Good reader | 9.7s |
  | Expert | 9.1s |
  | Alternating masher (best case, 10/s) | 10.7s, and often never finishes |
  | Guessing / drumming both thumbs | 15–17s |
  | Amateur AI winner (median) | 10.8s |
  | Pro AI winner (median) | 9.2s |

## Step 2.1: 100m changes from the reference gameplay video
Frame-by-frame study of a 100m run in the 2009 original. Only the mechanics are
reimplemented here; the art and presentation are our own.
- **One target at a time.** Instead of two fixed pads, a single green target
  alternates sides. The first target after GO is always on the left.
  (Superseded in 2.2 by random sides.)
  - Each side's target reappears where that thumb last tapped (`pads.followThumb`).
  - The hit zone is still the whole screen half, so it stays forgiving.
  - A faint ring marks where the other thumb goes next.
- Hit feedback: the target bursts into an expanding ring. A wrong-side tap shows a
  red ✕ and doesn't count.
- **Finish dip** (new `dip` config).
  - 15m out, strides stop counting and you carry your speed (`carryDecel` 0.6 m/s²).
  - Both pads pulse orange. Press both thumbs within 60ms (Space on desktop) to lunge.
  - The chest leads by up to 1.0m. Finish time is when the chest crosses the line.
  - Measured with `tools/simulate.mjs` at 12 taps/s:

    | Dip | Effect |
    |---|---|
    | Perfect (about 3.5m out) | −0.10s |
    | 2m late | −0.04s |
    | No dip | 0 |
    | More than about 3m early | +0.8s (slide to a stop, get up, run it in) |

  - `armDelay` 0.3s and `chordWindow` 0.06s stop a fast tapper's last strides from
    triggering an accidental early dip.
- AI rivals dip too, with timing error per difficulty (`ai.*.dipError`).
- Open question: in the video the target switches only about 2.5 times per second,
  yet the runner is at full speed, so the original may be rhythm-based rather than
  mash-based. Not changed yet. (Answered in 2.2: it's random targets.)

## Step 2: 100m Dash playable
- Runner physics: taps → smoothed cadence → target speed → speed (limited accel / coast decel).
- Initial calibration with the simulator (0.22s reaction):

  | taps/s | time |
  |---|---|
  | 8 | 12.8s |
  | 10 | 11.0s |
  | 12 | 9.9s |
  | 13 | 9.4s |
  | 15 | 8.8s |

  The world record (8.90s) needs about 15 alternating taps per second.
  - `cadenceForTopSpeed` 14 → 15, `topSpeed` 12.6 → 13.4. At 14, times flattened
    at 9.13s, so the world record was impossible.
  - Amateur AI cadence 9.0–11.6 → 8.6–11.0: the winner is usually about 10.6s, so a
    decent tapper (about 10.5 taps/s) can win.
  - Pro AI cadence 12.0–14.2 → 11.6–13.8: the winner is usually about 9.2s. Not yet
    selectable.
- `minTapInterval` 0.04s: alternating taps closer than this are ignored, so slamming both thumbs together doesn't double-count.
- First tap after GO is never rejected. Its interval (your reaction time) is clamped to the top-speed cadence, so anticipating the gun gives no superhuman burst.
- False starts: one warning, second = disqualified.
- Countdown: "Get Set" lasts a random 1.1–2.3s so GO can't be timed.

## Step 1: scaffold
- Canvas scaffold, fixed-timestep game loop, scene manager, multi-touch input manager, camera.
- Placeholder stick-figure athlete ("Juno") with blendable poses.
- Portrait mode pauses the game and shows a "rotate your phone" hint.
